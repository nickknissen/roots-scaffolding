# Roots boilerplate setup

This repository is a scaffolding script to integrate and use the following projects together:  


* [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)
* [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis)
* [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) (with [Soil](https://github.com/roots/soil))

I used [roots/roots-example-project.com](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com) as insiration.
